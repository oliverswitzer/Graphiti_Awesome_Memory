# Full-stack Graphiti Memory Platform

</div>

A production-ready dev setup for a Graphiti memory platform, featuring a FastAPI adapter, React Admin UI, and background worker.

## Architecture

- **Graphiti**: Python framework for episodic/temporal knowledge graphs (integrated in Adapter and Worker).
- **Neo4j**: Graph database backend.
- **Adapter**: FastAPI service providing `append`, `query`, and `summary` endpoints.
- **Worker**: Redis + RQ background worker for async tasks.
- **Frontend**: React Admin UI for visualization and management.
- **Redis**: Message broker and cache.

## Features

- **Episodic Memory**: Store and retrieve user memories with temporal context.
- **Graph Visualization**: Interactive 3D knowledge graph with degree-based node coloring (Red=Top1, Yellow=Top2, Green=Top3, Blue=Others).
- **Admin Dashboard**: View user statistics, manage memories, and monitor system health.
- **Background Processing**: Async task queue for heavy operations.
- **Secure**: API Key authentication for API, JWT for Admin UI.

## Quick Setup

### 1. Clone & Configure

```bash
git clone -b dev https://github.com/GoGoButters/Graphiti_Awesome_Memory.git
cd Graphiti_Awesome_Memory

# Configure secrets
nano config.yml
```

Update `config.yml` with your API keys (LLM, Embeddings, Neo4j, etc.).

### 2. Start Services

```bash
# Generate env files and start Docker containers
bash scripts/generate_envs.sh
docker compose up -d --build
```

That's it! Services will be available at:

- **Adapter API**: <http://localhost:8000/docs>
- **Admin UI**: <http://localhost:3000>
- **Neo4j Browser**: <http://localhost:7474>

## API Usage

All API endpoints use `X-API-KEY` header for authentication (default: `adapter-secret-api-key`).

### Append Memory

Add a new memory episode for a user:

```bash
curl -X POST http://<SERVER_IP>:8000/memory/append \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: adapter-secret-api-key" \
  -d '{"user_id":"user123","text":"My name is Alice. I like robotics.","role":"user","metadata":{"source":"n8n"}}'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "episode_id": "user123_2025-12-01T12:00:00.000000+00:00",
  "status": "success"
}
```

#### With File Metadata (Document RAG)

This feature is designed for **Document RAG** scenarios where you use an **external text extractor and chunking** (e.g., n8n, LangChain). By passing `file_name`, you link multiple chunks to a single source document.

```bash
curl -X POST http://<SERVER_IP>:8000/memory/append \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: adapter-secret-api-key" \
  -d '{
    "user_id":"user123",
    "text":"Chunk #1 content...",
    "metadata":{
      "source":"n8n",
      "file_name":"report_2024.pdf"
    }
  }'
```

This allows for bulk deletion of all chunks belonging to this file later.

### Query Memory

Search user's memories using semantic search:

```bash
curl -X POST http://<SERVER_IP>:8000/memory/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: adapter-secret-api-key" \
  -d '{"user_id":"user123","query":"What does Alice like?","limit":5}'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "fact": "Alice likes robotics",
      "score": 0.95,
      "uuid": "edge-uuid-123",
      "created_at": "2025-12-01T12:00:00+00:00",
      "metadata": {
        "file_name": null
      }
    }
  ],
  "total": 1
}
```

### Query Memory (Grouped by Source)

Search user's memories and get results grouped by source (files vs conversation):

```bash
curl -X POST http://<SERVER_IP>:8000/memory/query/grouped \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: adapter-secret-api-key" \
  -d '{"user_id":"user123","query":"What medical tests were done?","limit":10}'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "groups": [
    {
      "source_type": "file",
      "source_name": "mri_results.pdf",
      "facts": [
        {"fact": "MRI shows dystrophic changes...", "score": 0.95, ...}
      ]
    },
    {
      "source_type": "conversation",
      "source_name": null,
      "facts": [
        {"fact": "User mentioned headaches...", "score": 0.85, ...}
      ]
    }
  ],
  "total_facts": 5
}
```

This endpoint is useful for AI agents that need to understand where each fact came from.

### Generate Summary

Create a summary of user's memories:

```bash
curl -X POST http://<SERVER_IP>:8000/memory/summary \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: adapter-secret-api-key" \
  -d '{"user_id":"user123"}'
```

### Delete File (Bulk Cleanup)

Delete all episodes and orphaned entities associated with a specific file:

```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://<SERVER_IP>:8000/memory/files?user_id=user123&file_name=report_2024.pdf" \
  -H "X-API-KEY: adapter-secret-api-key"
```

This is useful for re-indexing documents or removing outdated knowledge.

### Get User Episodes

Retrieve user's recent episodes with optional limit:

```bash
curl -H "X-API-KEY: adapter-secret-api-key" \
  "http://<SERVER_IP>:8000/memory/users/user123/episodes?limit=10"
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "episodes": [
    {
      "created_at": "2025-12-01T12:00:00+00:00",
      "source": "n8n (user)",
      "content": "My name is Alice. I like robotics."
    }
  ],
  "total": 1
}
```

### Admin Endpoints (JWT Authentication)

Admin endpoints require JWT token obtained by logging into the Admin UI at `http://<SERVER_IP>:3000`.

#### User Management

- `GET /admin/users` - List all users with episode counts
- `GET /admin/users/{user_id}/graph` - Get user's knowledge graph
- `GET /admin/users/{user_id}/episodes?limit=N` - Get user episodes (admin)
- `DELETE /admin/users/{user_id}` - Delete user and all data

#### File Management

- `GET /admin/users/{user_id}/files` - List user files and chunk counts
- `DELETE /admin/users/{user_id}/files?file_name=...` - Delete all chunks for a file
- `DELETE /admin/episodes/{episode_uuid}` - Delete specific episode

#### Backup & Restore

- `GET /admin/users/{user_id}/backup` - Create and download backup (`.tar.gz` with episodes, entities, edges)
- `POST /admin/users/restore` - Upload and restore backup file
  - Supports restoring to different user ID
  - **Safe MERGE mode** - never deletes existing data, only adds/updates
  - Handles UTF-8 properly for all languages

#### Reprocessing (Graph Rebuild)

- `POST /admin/reprocess/{user_id}` - Reprocess episodes to rebuild Entity nodes
- `POST /admin/reprocess-all` - Reprocess all users
  - **Safe mode** - does NOT delete episodes, only creates Entity nodes
  - Useful after Graphiti updates or to fix missing graph data
  - May create duplicate episodes (can be cleaned later if needed)

## Performance Optimization

### Dual-Model Strategy

The platform uses a **dual-model strategy** for optimal performance:

- **Main LLM** (`llm`): Used for high-quality fact extraction (20% of operations)
- **Fast LLM** (`llm_fast`): Used for simple operations like deduplication and validation (80% of operations)

This provides **5-10x speedup** without sacrificing accuracy.

#### Configuration

Configure both models in `config.yml`:

```yaml
llm:
  base_url: http://your-server:4000/v1
  api_key: your-key
  model: qwen2.5-32b-instruct  # Reasoning model for quality

llm_fast:
  base_url: http://your-server:4000/v1
  api_key: your-key
  model: qwen2.5:7b  # Fast non-reasoning model

# Optional: Reranker for improved search relevance
reranker:
  base_url: http://your-reranker:8080/v1
  api_key: your-key
  model: jina-reranker-v2
```

#### Concurrency Tuning

The platform supports up to 100 concurrent LLM operations (default: 10). This is configured via `SEMAPHORE_LIMIT` in `docker-compose.yml`.

For local LLM servers that support high concurrency, you can increase this limit:

```yaml
environment:
  - SEMAPHORE_LIMIT=100  # Increase for faster processing
```

**Recommendation**: Start with 50-100 for local servers, 10-20 for API providers with rate limits.

## Development

### Directory Structure

- `backend/adapter`: FastAPI application.
- `worker`: Background worker.
- `frontend`: React Admin UI.
- `infra`: Infrastructure config (Nginx).

### Running Tests

```bash
make test
```

## Security Notes

- **Secrets**: In production, use a secret manager (Vault, K8s Secrets) instead of `.env` files.
- **Auth**:
  - Adapter uses API Key (`X-API-KEY`).
  - Admin UI uses JWT (Login with credentials from `config.yml`).
- **Network**: Ensure Neo4j and Redis ports are not exposed to the public internet in production.
